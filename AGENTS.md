- mono repo for open ai's codex agent.
- one folder per project/idea. all self contained
- prefer uv over pip/venv for project management
- stick to uv's syntax if possible (e.g. prefer uv add to uv pip install)
- initialise project with uv init
- prefer marimo over jupyter notebooks
- prefers polars over pandas
- prefer altair or plotnine over matplotlib or seaborn

if doing front end/fulls stack work:
- prefer next.js and svelte (5 if possible) over other similar tools

- - broswe the internet and read the docs whener you're lost, best of luck!
